## 🕹️ Use Case

We’ve all heard the most popular question asked at lunch tables or during casual team chats:  
**"What did you do over the weekend?"** (on Mondays) or  
**"What are your weekend plans?"** (on Fridays).

This Bingo game was designed to turn that question into a fun and engaging **ice-breaker**, perfect for Mondays and Fridays.  
Each Bingo cell represents a possible activity or plan. As team members share their experiences or intentions, they can mark their boards — making the conversation more inclusive, interactive, and fun.

This also opens the door for:

- Sharing personal hobbies and plans
- Sparking interest in group activities
- Encouraging stronger bonds within micro and macro teams
